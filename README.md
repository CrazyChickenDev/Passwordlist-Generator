A python code that collates a list of data fed into it then generates possible and most suitable randomised password combinations gotten from those details fed into it. Data collated includes those found on social media accounts, personal bios and events/experiences. The conclusive information can be used potentially by cyber-security researchers, penetration testers and other professionals in the InfoSec field. This code also serves it's the purpose in threat management and detection institutions for either the malicious intent to crack passwords or solve cyber-threat situations. My idea behind the writing of this code was to implement social-engineering practices in cracking passwords and breaking through personal or institutional defences by having just a little amount of information about the situation. The code would aid penetration testers at being able to collectively deduce possible passwords and instances without getting involved with the targeted party. This program was created for educational purposes and as a security research tool.

### About:grin:

It's quite known that humans include personal information in their passwords, this includes information that can often be found on social media accounts and these can potentially be used by cybercriminals for malicious purposes to crack passwords. Examples of such information include:

- Their own name or the name of a family member
- Their petâ€™s name
- Their birth date
- Words related to their hobbies
- Parts of their home address
- Favorite books or movies
- Celebrity names
- The name of the website the password is for

```
 This program is an interactive list generator that will create a password wordlist that can be used in penetration testing and forensic investigations to crack passwords
```

### Usage

Run the program on your terminal with:

```$ python passwordlist.py```

- The password list will be created in the same folder in .txt

### Requirements
- Python 3
